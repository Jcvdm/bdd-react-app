# 🛠️ BDD React App: A Simple Project for Behavior-Driven Development

![BDD React App](https://img.shields.io/badge/BDD%20React%20App-Ready%20for%20Development-brightgreen)

Welcome to the **BDD React App** repository! This project showcases how to implement Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using **React 19**, **Cucumber.js**, and **Playwright**. It serves as a practical example for developers who want to learn about BDD principles and practices while building modern web applications.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started, you can download the latest release of the BDD React App from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Jcvdm/bdd-react-app/releases). Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jcvdm/bdd-react-app.git
   cd bdd-react-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary packages using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Running Tests**

   To run the BDD tests, execute:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   This will run all your Cucumber.js tests using Playwright.

## 📖 Project Overview

### 🌟 Features

- **React 19**: Utilizes the latest features of React for building user interfaces.
- **Cucumber.js**: Implements BDD practices with easy-to-read feature files.
- **Playwright**: Provides powerful end-to-end testing capabilities.
- **Vite**: Offers a fast development environment with hot module replacement.

### 🧪 Testing

This project focuses on testing user interactions and application behavior. With Cucumber.js, you can write your tests in a natural language format, making it easier for non-developers to understand. Playwright allows you to run these tests across different browsers.

### 📝 Documentation

The documentation is designed to help you understand how to use and contribute to the project. You can find detailed instructions and examples in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Jcvdm/bdd-react-app/wiki).

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Cucumber.js**: A testing framework that supports BDD.
- **Playwright**: A Node.js library for browser automation.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool for fast development.
